		Russia:
			Removed Ukrainian Breadbasket pop growth bonus and, instead, buffed all provinces starting liferating by 3 (35 --> 38 for example).
		Portugal:
			Macao has been lowered from a starting state to a starting colony (now benefits from treaty port).

			0.5 Cement
			0.25 Lumber
			0.05 Machine Parts

	Army Stat Changes:
		Planes have had their default brigade size lowered from 3000 to 2000 (brigade damage is based on a ratio to 3000 pops in a regiment, so a unit at 2,000 does 66.7% damage as a 3,000 brigade), but had their base damage increased by 33.4%.
		Tanks have had their default brigade size increased from 3000 to 4000 (brigade damage is based on a ratio to 3000 pops in a regiment, so a unit at 4,000 does 133.4% damage as a 4,000 brigade).
	Inventions - Changes:
		All country wide industrial buffs, like electricity and nitroglycerin, no longer exist and all of their bonuses have been pushed directly to their corresponding inventions. (No more hidden tech/invention bonuses)
	Immigration Overhaul:
		Immigrants now split, monthly, between North and South America (Australia and South Africa are officially off the roster until they can be rebalanced in the future)
		Examples:
			If there are 10k immigrants batched to join on January, all 10k will go to North America to then be split in competition between the top 3 North American countries based on immigration priority (reforms and economy)
			If there are 10k immigrants batched to join on February, all 10k will go to South America to then be split in competition between the top 3 South American countries based on immigration priority (reforms and economy)
			IMPORTANT: If you make sure there are less than 3 powers on North or South America, the share that was meant for the third nation will spill into the other region. (i.e. if you want 100% immigrants all the time, kill the other continent.)
	National Value - Changes:
		NV Change decision cooldown has been lowered from 10 years to 5 years.
		NV Liberty is no longer necessary to receive immigrants and now gives 12.5% political AND social reform desire.
		NV Equality no longer reduces militancy in unaccepted pops. (Was causing issues obtaining reforms)
		NV Productivity no longer gives 5% tax efficiency.
		NV Autocracy no longer gives a mobilization bonus.
		NV Order no longer gives starting experience and land organisation. It now gives a 2% promotion chance bonus to soldiers as long as your nation is below 4.5% soldier pops. (Soldier Nat Focus gives 20%, this is functionally a free soldier focus if your country has at least 10 states.)

- Nerfed Anglosphere (Canada and Australia) starting reforms and made them both absolute monarchies as a test implementation. South africa and the Boer states have been removed from the immigration system until a better implementation can be performed.
- Added 3 decisions to Britain to annex Canada, Australia, or South Africa within the first year of the game if they are AI.
- Total war CBs that traditionally turned on in 1930 have now been put behind a host decision to enable, just like zombies.
- The host nation is now protect from all CBs.
- Added a USA decision to remove existing CSA cores post civil war. Helps alleviate a rebel issue that has been occuring with assimilation rework.
- Removed the random american cores causing assimilation issues. (Manhattan commune, New England, Deseret)
- Buffed American Homestead act to now give 50% global immigrant attraction (from 30%) and gave Mexico an alternative Homestead Act that gives 30% global immigrant attraction. The statue of liberty gives 30% for comparison.
- Implemented a new union for the new south andean culture, Peru-Bolivia, and stole HFMs flags for it but I'm using my own decision for it. The quickest way to achieve it is own Lima as Bolivia (or have it puppeted/sphered) or own La Paz (or have it puppeted/sphered) and have 25 prestige.
- Andean has been split into an inaccurate north and south andean to compliment the new Peru-Bolivia change. At the start of the game, GCO has 1.5 million pops / 1.4 million accepted. PBC (peru-bolivia) has 1.45 million / 1.2 million accepted.
- Grand Columbia and Peru-Bolivia both accepted north and south andean.
- Added Peru, Bolivia, and Peru-Bolivia to the options for the Statue of Liberty decision.

- New Prussia to NGF formation concept implementation:
	- At the start of the game, prussia will have a random chance to begin auto annexing its spherelings. The chance of annexation will increase in 1845, 1855, and 1860+ it will be almost automatic. (Use that diplomacy national value!)
	- Once all the spherelings no longer exist or the year is 1870 Prussia may form NGF. (Alsace not required)
	- German formation will be typical, sphere the south germans and own alsace-lorraine.
	- Upon annexation, all former cores of that minor are removed and replaced with Prussian cores.
	- Once NGF forms, all existing german minors + prussia cores are dropped and replaced with NGF.
- Pan nationalist rebels have been removed, including garibaldi redshirts. Italy and Germany must be formed via formation.
- A modifier has been added to China that reduces any researchpoints it may receive from conquest as an unciv to 0. (It will never receive research points from conquest.)
- (Bugfix) Removed some weird ass sea connection between Nagasaki and Cheju.
- Japan Buffs
	- All primary islands in Japan are now "land" connections, meaning they cannot be blockaded.
	- The Hokkaido to Sakhalin to East Manchuria connections are re-established and are now "sea" connections, which can be blockaded.

	- Changed the input(lowered)/output(increased) ratios for synthetic oil factories and fuel factories to actually be profitable and help meet the late game demand.
	- New Factory: Synthetic Rubber Factory, that turns oil into rubber at a profitable ratio.
- Army Unit Changes
	- Lower Airplane damage so that it, after ALL calculations, do 90 damage in the backline compared to specialized artillery doing 80.8 in the backline. (Significantly better balance compared to before)
	- General Tank and Airplane stat balances to make sure they have equal attack and defense, plus I removed a random point of manuever off of planes just in case it causes any issues.
	- Supply consumption rebalance for Planes so that they are the most expensive unit and there won't be this general "cheapness" that has been present since inception.
		- Base Monthly Consumption Prices using all tech and inventions (can be referenced in unit stat sheet)
			- Artillery: 20.955 per unit
			- Tanks: 28.48 per unit
			- Planes: 31.12 per unit (for reference, it used to be 14.)
	- Guards have been removed entirely to allow for a cleaner unit curve into mechanization. (Noted in unit stat sheet as well)

	- Each state is at least 400k pop (5 total states at start)
	- Each state has 4, 5, or 6 provinces (helps fit better into warscore balance model)
	- Persia, Makran, Afghanistan, and Kalat are now all known by their wider language group "Aryan" as the new culture.
	- All Central Asians are now classified by their language group "Turkic"
	- Reworked Herat decision to now give cores on Afghanistan, Kalat, and Makran.
	- Added a new decision to Persia to get Turkic accepted, but no new cores. (Ideally new coring system should reward what they can take and hold, but no free revanchism because russia owns it all)
	- Changed RGOs around to make up for the removed provinces. Heavier emphasis on Wool, with a few military resources spotted around.
	- Tabriz will now turn into oil in the late game.

	- Xrays no longer gives pop growth to account for the removal of the negatives. (xrays gave 0.0002% total)
- Deleted leftover / unused cultures in cultures.txt (people swear by this reducing lag, we'll see)
- Moved the mobilization button slightly to the left to avoid accidentally clicking it mid war when going to recruit units. It now has a Blue Mobilize button, and once you have clicked it, turns red and says Demobilize. I know you idiots need clear color coding.
- Prussia now starts with the diplomacy national value turned on.
- Starting liferating buff to the western hemisphere has been tuned down from 37 liferating to 35 liferating.

- Statue of Liberty rework:
	- Statue of Liberty decision now gives France an event to choose who in the western hemisphere receives the statue of liberty.
	- Statue of Liberty assimilation rate decreased from 100% to 25%.
- Unit Stats: (updated in Army Unit Stats file)
	- Planes are now balanced equally for attack and defense and won't have that awkward 12% support hanging around.
- Factory Changes:
	All Factories:
		- Maintenance costs have been lowered for cement from 0.5 to 0.25, and lumber has been added for a consumption of 0.25 (about 25% cheaper maintenance costs)
		- All factory construction now requires lumber.
	Fabrics:
		- Cotton factories now require 3 less cotton for input per tier.
		- Wool factories have been rebalance to only require 30 wool instead of 50. (Puts this in line to match profitability of cotton factories.)
		- Industrial Tannery (new building) has been added to provide an alternative source of fabric using cattle, and matching the same base profitability that cotton and wool have.
		- Having all 3 fabric factories in 1 state will buff a regular clothes factory in that state by 45% (15% each)
- Japan Buff
	- Japan now starts with 3 decisions to join UK, USA, or Russias sphere within the first year of the game (1836).
	- Japan now starts with 2 tech reforms, flintlock rifles and bronze artillery. (unlocking regulars and artillery day 1)

	- Removed social reform desire.
- AI Unit Priority Rework
	- AI will now build equal portion artillery / infantry and about a tenth of their units will be horses.
	- AI will now only build transports and light ships (beneficial for AI puppets, but the single player AI shits the bed)
- Complete Assimilation rework v2
	- Took me for literally ever, but now assimilation base line rate is the same for all pops and provinces in the game.
	- Rates:
		Increases: Everyday and Luxury good access, equality national value, and new world nation flagged nations in new world continents.
		Decrease: militancy, unemployment, and not meeting Life needs.
	I've put the specific rates but they will literally not make sense, just trust me bro.
	Balance Concept:
		Assimilation rates should never overcome pop growth rates of the minority. So, to understand how assimilation works now, view it as a sort of vampire/parasite that saps the pop growth of minorities to supplement the growing accepted cultures in the state/province.

You are now guaranteed to inherit all substates that are left upon westernization as china.

Tibet is now cored by china and is considered a substate. This should allow tibet to be inherited upon chinese westernization. This is intended to cleanup the map because in 99% of games, tibet remains a chinese puppet all game.
Eliminated ainu pockets and replaced them with japanesse to help with lag.
Eliminated asian_minor pockets across asia and replaced them with their primary culture in their area to help with lag.
Completed Indian population rework. Pops are now defined by their language group to reduce lag (indo-aryan and dravidian). Doctrine of lapse does work properly with the new cultures.

Minimum wage reform now lowers life needs requirement for poor strata by 10% for each tier, up to 40% reduction.
African continent has been given cultures that reflect their historical language groups as accurately as I could. Generic domains should inherit these new cultures normally.
Chinese pops have been redone into 2 major groups, north han and south han. The periphery substates have the same pops. (mongol, manchu, etc)
Indian pops have been redone into 4 major culture groups: tamil, avadhi, marathi, and bengali. Bengali is the only non-accepted.

Order: Buffed starting experience to 30 from 25, added a Leadership bonus modifier which essentially doubles the monthly leadership point gain (good for fishing for good generals)
Autocracy: Buffed mobilization size from 1% to 2.5%
Productivity: Now gives 5% industry tech research bonus instead of commerce.
Equality: Now gives a 500% assimilation rate national focus. (works well in conjunction with Assimilation rework.)
Garibaldi Redshirts can now spawn in Sardinia. Important Italian information for puir base redshirts: (important information for tech inheritance and reforms)
	if redshirts pop in two sicilies and win, sardinia AUTOMATICALLY becomes italy
	if redshirts pop in sardinia and win, two sicilies AUTOMATICALLY becomes italy
	if redshirts pop anywhere else in italy and win, sardinia AUTOMATICALLY becomes italy
	If either power is a great power and the other is not, they will AUTOMATICALLY become italy

Bugfixed a lot of issues with Anti Italy. It can no longer be released via CB or satellite. (bugfix)

	diplomatic_points_modifier = -1.0
	org_regain = -0.2
    land_organisation = -0.2
    naval_organisation = -0.2

Added another start date with commonwealth powers seperated at the start. (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa.)

----------------------------------------------------
Changes for 3.0.6

Rework for Italian formation:
	- If either Two Sicilies or Sardinia is a GP, that power is guaranteed to become Italy. If neither party is a Great Power upon formation, the target will be random between them.
	- The power that did not form italy will then be given the decision to become Anti-Italy, and have the same cores as Italy. Once one of the 2 Italian states own all of the peninsula's cores (including sicily but excluding sardinia, venetia, south tirol, and istria) they will be able to wipe all the opponents cores off of Italy.
	- Anti-Italy is literally just Italy but they have cores on one another to restore order / core war.

Changes for 3.0.2

Added decision for China and Japan at the start of the game to remove their protection flag or enable it, respectively. (Protection from land grab CBs and starting land grab CBs until 1865)
Reverted mobilization civ requirement because of protection / no protection decision addition.

----------------------------------------------------
Changes for 3.0.1

Removed Chinese auto removal from sphere of influence event (oversight)
Removed Taiping rebellion to prevent researchpoints cheesing pre-1865 for China.
Blocked some key mobilization inventions from China until it westernizes
Non accepted bureaucrats will now force demote to farmers/labourers.
Added everything to treaty ports CB that was meant to be there originally.

----------------------------------------------------
Changes for 3.0

Japan now starts with 500 clipper goods so they are no longer hostage to the world market at the start.
Colonial migration rework now allows colonial pops who are unemployed to move to other colonies within your control for employment. (Most effectively seen with Indian colonies + Chinese Colonies)
tl;dr Foreign investment is very important now. The base sphere market guarantees from secondaries (50%) and civs (75%) have now been reduced to 0. This means that the % of your foreign investment in your sphereling corresponds to your ratio of their goods you acquire. Sphere guide goes into more detail, but foreign investing in an enemies sphereling and bringing their total % down directly reduces the amount of goods they get from that sphereling into their sphere market by that amount. 
All economic policies can now give and receive foreign investment.
Sphere influence malluses in regards to population have been removed. If you border target country - 50% more influence, your sphere borders target country - 25% more influence, different continent - 25% less influence, and a scaling score ratio mallus / boon based on how low the GP score is relative to the target they are trying to sphere.
Grants have been fixed to allow larger amounts to be transferred.
Added a decision for players that have had a states factory hijacked by non-core pops as the craftsmen. It will convert them out of craftsmen so the earlier you do it the better. The decision has more information in its info box.
Reduced mean time to happen for core integration event from 80 months to 40 months, effectively halving the base amount. It is still sped up by revolution and counter revolution tech + nationalism and imperialism + low militancy. Slowed down by high militancy.
Made Planes functionally artillery instead of cavalry (oversight)
Made Tanks functionally cavalry instead of infantry (oversight)
Horse inventions (hussar, dragoon, cuirassier) are now 100% invention chance.
Machine guns invention is now a 100% invention chance.
Mission to Civilize, Colonial Negotiations, and Indigenous Garrisoning (all the colonial inventions) now have a 100% invention chance IF any other GP has already discovered it.
Changed Latin Monetary Union from -1% import cost (broken) and -5% tarrif efficiency to +5% tax efficiency.
Ethiopia has been deleted as a starting nation and all of its land has been set to 20 liferating so that it is apart of the middle stage african colonization.
Added modified hpm national values (heavily modified) and the ability to change them as any country any 10 years to any of the national values.
Added cross colonial migration hooked directly into unemployment. (Unemployed colonial pops will, rather quickly, migrate to other colonies where they will be employed.) They behave normally in regards to colony to state and colony to emigration.
Doctrine of Lapse now works accordingly for both civilized and uncivilized India, they must still be a british puppet though.
Max warscore from battles is now 25, from 50.
Australia and Canada have had their minorities removed to see if this solves the assimilation soldier bug causing those idiots to have 17% soldiers.
Changed bonus import cost from owning suez and panama (it did nothing) to 5% tax efficiency.
Colonial pops can now migrate to your states if they meet a literacy threshold of atleast 70%, increasing in chance at 80%, 90%, and 100%. (You'll start seeing movement at 70%). Primary and accepted pops in your colonies will NOT be affected by this change.
China Rework:
	China is now playable for multiplayer.
	Until 1865 china cannot build any other CB except humiliate, cut down to size, and reparations.
	Until 1865 only limited wargoals are available on china: treaty port / substate region / reparations / etc you can check for yourself.
	Added a china specific concession CB that costs 400% more warscore for when it is unciv. Once China westernizes, they will be using typical civ CBs.
	China will be nerfed by 80% of its starting pop down to 21 million pops, 17 million of which are accepted, these numbers are excluding the substates which auto annex upon westernization. ( Comparable to Russian pop by 1865 )
	The 3 untouchable Chinese puppets have been integrated into greater china.
	China now accepts Southern Han. Taiping now accepts Manchu and Southern Han. (just in case)
